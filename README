A quick analysis and prediction against the Practice Fusion Kaggle dataset. 
This project will grow as I expand the predictions from using main effects to
a selection of ICD9 codes.

However, I plan to do this without any prior "domain" knowledge of diabetes symptoms. There are 
far too many ICD9 codes available to thus the first next task is feature engineering off 
the ICD9 codes for known diabetes patients. Obviously, this will be for ICD9 codes that
are not classified as diabetes diagnoses, but are related to the diabetes condition.

The initial analysis had a logit and random forest compete against one another. The 
specific question was to estimate the number of undiagnosed diabetes. Thus, you 
will see some extra splitting of the dataset to create a sample of patients who may
have diabetes but have not been diagnosed by their physician.
