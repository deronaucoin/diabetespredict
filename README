A quick analysis and prediction against the Practice Fusion Kaggle dataset. 
This project will grow as I expand the predictions from using main effects to
a selection of ICD9 codes.

However, I plan to do this without any prior "domain" knowledge of diabetes symptoms. 

The initial analysis had a logit and random forest compete against one another. The 
specific question was to estimate the number of undiagnosed diabetes. Thus, you 
will see some extra splitting of the dataset to create a sample of patients who may
have diabetes but have not been diagnosed by their physician.
